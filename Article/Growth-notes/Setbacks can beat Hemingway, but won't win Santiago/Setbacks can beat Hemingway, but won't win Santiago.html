            Today is really exciting. First of all, I couldn't find my belt in the morning. As a result, I didn't go to
            the canteen for dinner. I ate some compressed biscuits casually. Then I went on stage to talk about the test
            report. I couldn't hold my breath for half a day.Half a sentence, a wave of embarrassment, and finally was
            told by the counselor that the fucking reason for poor freshman grades was repealed. I have to say, really
            exciting. But stimulation and sadness It has no use. If there is a problem, it will try to make up for it.
            First of all, if you do not find the belt, go back to the dormitory and look for it again. Then we will talk
            about the test report, the embarrassment field, the next few lectures.Read and use speech. Finally, if you
            repeat the grade, you will find a way to stay in the end. In the subject you are hanging, you can take the
            entrance exam of 1 this year. Look at the high number and do the high number. And now I find myself.
            There are too few things I can do. I can speak some languages, but I can't see their practical use. So I
            want to learn Android and make Apps. Scientific data mining is applied to App.Machine learning? To be honest
            , I think it's too immature. We should put it back in order to learn how to use some basic algorithms. As
            for classes, the efficiency of schools is really low.I want to have classes with 1603 of my classmates.
            Previous plans were to support three groups of tablets every day, quickly browse words for three minutes
            (scallops), and write a blog.Now the plan should be changed to three groups of tablets per day, three minutes
            of quick browsing of words (scallops), a diary or sentiment blog and a technical or mathematical blog.

            I like Wukong in the Dragon Ball, not because he is so powerful, but because he can grow at the speed of
            light every time he faces difficulties. Grow up, my wild youth!

            今天真的很刺激，首先一大早找不到皮带，结果没去食堂吃饭，随便吃了点压缩饼干，然后又上台讲测试报告，半天憋不出
            半句话，狠狠地尴尬了一波，最后还被辅导员告知他妈的因为大一成绩太差的原因被留级。不得不说，真刺激。但刺激与悲伤
            都没有任何用处，出了问题就想办法弥补。首先，没找到皮带就回寝室后再找找。然后讲测试报告尬场就学学演讲，下下几本
            演讲书看看、用用。最后留级了就想办法不一留到底，挂的科目里，今年考高数1，看看高数，做做高数。然后现在我发现我
            会的东西太少了，我会一些语言，但我看不到他们的实际用处，所以我要学学安卓，做做App。学学数据挖掘，应用到App里，
            机器学习吗，老实说我觉得还太不成熟了，应该后置，学学几个基本算法的运用就行了把。至于上课，学校的效率是真低，
            我想还是和1603的同学们一起上课吧。以前的计划是：每天，平板支撑3组，快速浏览单词3分钟（扇贝），写一篇博客。
            现在计划应该改为每天，平板支撑3组，快速浏览单词3分钟（扇贝），写一篇日记或感悟博客以及一篇技术或数学博客。
