                I used to write a blog on csdn, but I gave up before long. At that time, I thought it was because I
                was too tired to write a blog, but now I know it was because I thought my time was limitless and I
                didn't think it was necessary to write a blog.

                There are two classes today. I was going to write the observer model, but I didn't do the design model and
                modeling homework. I got up late again in the morning, so I did my homework in the morning.In the noon class
                , in the evening inexplicable special disgust summarizes the design pattern and my-insights this column also
                does not have any documents, looks ugly. So temporary Change to write a diary. Well, this is not good.After
                that, I need to get up at 8 o'clock every day, alarm clock and go to bed early.
